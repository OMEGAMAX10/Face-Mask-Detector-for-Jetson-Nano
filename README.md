# Face-Mask-Detector-on-Jetson-Nano
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, more and more people are concerned with protecting themselves using masks, thus the need of software capable of monitoring whether the people are wearing masks or not. That is why I created a Python application using OpenCV(with CUDA support) based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, capable of monitoring the safety level of a space with video surveillance. This is the Jetson Nano version of the application.
